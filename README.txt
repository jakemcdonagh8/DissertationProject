The following project is a dissertation project created by Jake McDonagh (jam93@aber.ac.uk) for the CS39440 module.

seen on the Dragons: Race to the Edge series.

Assets - The main folder where the majority of the project has been implemented in over the course of the module.
Assets -> DissertationProject - All of the main work including animations, prefabs and scripts etc. 
Assets -> DissertationProject -> Scripts - The main scripts used to implment the software of this project. The files can be opened

Builds -> Windows - The .exe and other relevant files needed to run the application on a windows device.
Builds -> Android - The .apk and other relevant files needed to run the application on an Android device. Please install the .apk file in order
		    to run the application.

		 NOTE: ASIDE FROM THE WATER PREFAB THAT IS LOCATED WITHIN THE TILES FOLDER, NONE OF THE ASSETS WITHIN THIS FOLDER ARE BEING USED
